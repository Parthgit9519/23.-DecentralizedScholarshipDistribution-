# 🎓 Decentralized Scholarship Distribution

## 📌 Project Title
23. Decentralized Scholarship Distribution

---

## 🧠 Project Description
This project is a **blockchain-based scholarship management system** built using Solidity. It allows educational institutions or organizations to **transparently distribute scholarships** to students without relying on intermediaries. The entire process — from fund collection to distribution — happens on-chain, ensuring **trust, traceability, and immutability**.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision
To eliminate corruption, delays, and opacity in traditional scholarship systems by leveraging **smart contracts** for **secure, automated, and transparent fund allocation** to deserving students.

---

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Transparent Donations:** Anyone can add scholarship funds publicly.
- **Secure Student Registration:** Only the admin can register eligible students with pre-decided amounts.
- **Automated Distribution:** Scholarships are directly transferred to student wallets, reducing manual handling.
- **Event Logs:** Every transaction (fund addition, registration, and distribution) is recorded for complete transparency.
- **Viewable Ledger:** Anyone can check registered students and track fund usage on-chain.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Integration with **IPFS** for storing student documents and proof of eligibility.
- Multi-admin system with DAO voting for fairer scholarship approvals.
- Web3 frontend using **React + Ethers.js** for user-friendly interaction.
- **Tokenization** of scholarship funds for cross-border transactions.
- Real-time dashboards for transparency and audit trails.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Solidity (v0.8.20)** for Smart Contracts  
- **Hardhat / Remix IDE** for Development and Testing  
- **Ethereum Testnet (Goerli / Sepolia)** for Deployment  
- **MetaMask** for Wallet Interaction
